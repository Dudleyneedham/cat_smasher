# Cat Smasher
A cat game built with Bevy. My first attempt at game development and rust project.

Cat smasher is a typical cat who wants to cause damage and destruction in the house of their human.
For what reason, I don't know... You decide.
Your role is the cat.
The cat goes on a rampage throughout the home whilst the human is picking or fixing the items cast aside by the feline protagonist.
The human wants to pet and inform you how cute you are.
But we know that already.
Your escapade is slowly sapping your energy levels.
Each action will lower your energy, but you can drink or eat to gain vital energy to show that human who is boss (It's you, by the way).
You earn points with the more destruction you cause.
See that carpet fuck that carpet.
Scratch it up; you are the ruler in your kingdom.
Before the human reaches you to pet you (which you love but never tell them), you must cause enough destruction to get through the level.
Once you have reached enough points, you must reach the bed and take a well-deserved nap.


## ToDos

* Decide on a physics engine.
* Get the map sorted.
* Write a better todo list.
* Try ldtk.
* Implement human behaviour to follow the cat.
